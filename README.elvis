Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.  Elvis supports
nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and colon mode.

Elvis runs under BSD UNIX, AT&T SysV UNIX, SCO Xenix, Minix, MS-DOS
(Turbo-C or MSC 5.10), Atari TOS, OS9/68000, Coherent, VMS, and
AmigaDos.  An OS/2 port is included here for the first time; it might
need tweaking.  Ports to other operating systems are in progress.
Contact me before you start porting it to some other OS, because
somebody else may have already done it for you.

Elvis is freely redistributable, in either source form or executable
form.

For brief instructions on how to compile and install Elvis, see the
INSTALL file.  For more complete instructions, you should begin by
reading the appropriate part of the "VERSIONS" section of the manual
("versions.doc"), and also the whole "CFLAGS" and "MAKEFILE" sections
("cflags.doc" and "makefile.doc").
